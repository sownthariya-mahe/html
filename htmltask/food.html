<p>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. <br> is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, <br>
    such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life,<br>
     stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.</p>

    <center><h2>FISH CURRY</h2></center>
    <center><image src="fish.jpg"no image" hieght="100" width="100"></image></center>
    <p>ALWAYS USE FULL-FAT COCONUT MILK - the lighter one is pretty much just coloured water - it won't bring any goodness to the sauce, and the curry will be rather bland. Make sure you use the coconut cream in it too - and you get one creamy, rich and fragrant sauce to lick you fingers clean.</p>
